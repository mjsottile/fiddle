Ideas:

Indexable space: a space in which one can reasonably define an index
Indexed element: a pair combining an indexable space and an index

indexable space: 
 - indices are integer multipliers on basis vectors that define the space
 - space is composed of an orthonormal basis vector set
 - dimension of space corresponds to number of basis vectors

indexable spaces provide an operator that given an index will rotate it
about one or more axes

want something to map these indexable spaces to a representation:
 - e.g., cartesian space to array
 - perhaps have an operator with an indexable space that corresponds to
   instantiation of that space?
